    "This project is about a classification model that examines a text file from news and performs binary classification; labeling that news as either fake or real. The model was trained using a dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset). The dataset consists of about 21000 news labeled as true and about 23000 news categorized as fake.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is inspired from a [research](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/liberals-and-conservatives-are-both-susceptible-to-fake-news-but-for-different-reasons/?WT.mc_id=send-to-friend) that suggests both liberals and conservatives are motivated to believe fake news, and dismiss real news that contradicts their ideologies. Fake news spread through social media has become a serious problem and this study aims to build an unbiased model that could detect news as fake or real.\n",

    "The first step in working with any dataset is loading the data in and noting what information is included in the dataset. This is an important step in eventually working with the data, and knowing what kinds of features we have to work with as we transform and group the data.

    "\n",
    "- Read a text file as a string of raw text.\n",
    "- Lower case all words, so that captialization is ignored (e.g., IndIcaTE is treated the same as Indicate).\n",
    "- Normalize numbers, replacing them with the text `number`.\n",
    "- Remove non-words, remove punctuation, and trim all white spaces (tabs, newlines, spaces) to a single space character.\n",
    "- Tokenize the raw text string into a list of words where each entry is a word. Tokenization is the act of breaking up a sequence of strings into pieces such as words, keywords, phrases, symbols and other elements called tokens. Tokens can be individual words, phrases or even whole sentences. In the process of tokenization, some characters like punctuation marks are discarded. The tokens become the input for another process like parsing and text mining. Then the words will be ready to be encoded as integers or floating point values for use as input to a machine learning algorithm, called feature extraction (or vectorization).\n",
    "- Use lemmatization or stemming to consolidate closely redundant words. For example, \"discount\", \"discounts\", \"discounted\" and \"discounting\" will be all replaced with \"discount\". Sometimes, the Stemmer actually strips off additional characters from the end, so \"include\", \"includes\", \"included\", and \"including\" are all replaced with \"includ\".\n",
    "- Remove stopwords. Stop words are so frequently used that for many tasks (but not all) they don't carry much information. Examples are \"any\", \"all\", \"what\", etc. NLTK has an inbuilt corpus of english stopwords that can be loaded and used.\n",
    "- Apply additional text preparation steps, such as normalizing links and emails: All https and http links will be replaced with the text \"link\" and all emails will be replaced with the text \"email\".\n",
    "- Render either a word cloud or a bar chart with the most frequent unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, etc.\n",
