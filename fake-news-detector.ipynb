    "- Remove non-words, remove punctuation, and trim all white spaces (tabs, newlines, spaces) to a single space character.\n",
    "- Tokenize the raw text string into a list of words where each entry is a word. Tokenization is the act of breaking up a sequence of strings into pieces such as words, keywords, phrases, symbols and other elements called tokens. Tokens can be individual words, phrases or even whole sentences. In the process of tokenization, some characters like punctuation marks are discarded. The tokens become the input for another process like parsing and text mining. Then the words will be ready to be encoded as integers or floating point values for use as input to a machine learning algorithm, called feature extraction (or vectorization).\n",
    "- Use lemmatization or stemming to consolidate closely redundant words. For example, \"discount\", \"discounts\", \"discounted\" and \"discounting\" will be all replaced with \"discount\". Sometimes, the Stemmer actually strips off additional characters from the end, so \"include\", \"includes\", \"included\", and \"including\" are all replaced with \"includ\".\n",
    "- Remove stopwords. Stop words are so frequently used that for many tasks (but not all) they don't carry much information. Examples are \"any\", \"all\", \"what\", etc. NLTK has an inbuilt corpus of english stopwords that can be loaded and used.\n",

    "\n",

This is called a \"bag\" because it disregards the order of the words within the text and focuses on content. A Bag of Words can be obtained using Sklearn's `CountVectorizer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **N-grams**\n",
    "\n",
    "A N-gram is a combination of N number of words treated as a single feature, as opposed to single word features in the Bag of Word. The idea is to extract contextual information and enrich data. For example the word \"good\" is always positive individually but can be negative when preceeded by \"not\". In certain cases, \"not good\" is an informative bigram. N-grams can also be extracted through sklearn's `CountVectorizer`, but with a specific parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (Tfidf)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than counting occurences, the TfIdf vectorizer computes an importance value for each word in its text and according the entire corpus. That value is the product of the TF and the IDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF(t) = (Number of times term t appears in a document) / (Total number of terms in the document)\n",
    "\n",
    "IDF(t) = log_e(Total number of documents / Number of documents with term t in it)\n",
    "\n",
    "The abovementioned steps of the Tfidf algorithm are automatized in Sklearn's `TfidfVectorizer` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** We could use and test all the aforementioned algorithms using Sklearn's `Pipeline` package, which combines all the steps and simplifies our work, but this is out of the scope of this project. So, we will use the Bag-of-Words model, but enabling `ngram_range=(1, 3)`, so as to use more features (unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams).\n",
    "\n",

Another difference is that since we aren't performing a fixed computation, as we were in the training step or while performing a batch transform, the compute instance that gets started stays running until we tell it to stop.
